- title: Alternately Updated Spectral–Spatial Convolution Network for the Classification of Hyperspectral Images
  image: aussc_19_remote_sensing.png
  description: The connection structure in the convolutional layers of most deep learning-based algorithms used for the classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has typically been in the forward direction. In this study, an end-to-end alternately updated spectral–spatial convolutional network (AUSSC) with a recurrent feedback structure is used to learn refined spectral and spatial features for HSI classification.
